# Gameplay

## Roles

At the start of the game you'll be given a special item if you have a unique role.

Note: I'm generally not a fan of having a ton of roles because I think it gets too distracting from the core gameplay so I may not add many others but a "Mimic" role is planned.

### Employee

**Objective**
- Reach the quota by carrying all the scrap you can find back to the ship
- Vote out the monsters


### Monster

**Objective**
- Kill all the employees
- Sabotage the crew to slow them down

## Shop

Collecting scrap will give you credits which you can use to buy certain items in the shop


## Meeting

When the round starts a horn will spawn. To call a meeting, you have to pull the lever.

## Minimap

Your minimap will only allow you to see yourself and the actual environment around you.

You can scroll up and down to zoom in or out.

**Important:** During a meeting your minimap is automatically set to your last location. You can place a dot down somewhere on the map to let others know where you were. (This will also allow you to see other people's location)

## Maps

To select a map, go to the terminal and type "moons" to see all your options (it automatically defaults to office).



# To-Do

- Hitting a vent with a shovel will force the monster out
- Bomber role (probably). A monster type that can spawn a limited amount of landmines at a time

some other stuff too but Im not listing them all
